It would be nice to know what efforts we can apply to approach improvements. I have batch if Muthu allows :)

What can i do every day:
1. Read or investigate a lot of code every day.
2. Subscribe to some amazing broadcasts: dev.to, stackoverflow.com, github projects sources etc.
3. SOLID approach can help a lot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID
4. Try to play with some code or participate in playgrounds.
5. Try to define a simple dev task and implement it weekly, make it as a hobby - it also will help you learn some new approaches and use some good patterns  automatically

Keep in mind:
1. Function size - less than 20(30) lines
2. less than 3-5 actions per function
3. File size less than 300 lines.
4. File per class approach (until internal classes definition).
5. Function should be able to be testet in a separate way.
6. Follow the SOLID.
